                        <p>
                            As a front-end engineer, I like to use Chrome as a dev tool in daily work, however, my favorite browser in MacOS is Safari. 
                            So I have developed Browser Opener, which can help you decide which browser to open automatically when you clicked an external link.

                        <p>
                            A website collecting Japanese anime watch lists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There has been a lot of Japanese anime come to Chinese video websites since 2013. But due to fragmentation of copyrights, it was hard to watch them on
                            one single website. That's why I started this project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website is also my playground of front-end technologies. It was first
                            written in plain HTML tables, and then be refactored to Angular, then jQuery, and finally
                            React. I'm recently considering making it to a Progress Web Application.
