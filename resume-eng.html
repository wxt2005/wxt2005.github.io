                            Worked as major front-end engineer of Cainiao post station business project, designed and
                            developed all front-end application it contains.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="inside-list">
                            <li>Divided the main application into three micro parts: shopping, payment and order center.
                                So that we could easily add new kinds of shopping pages anytime without touching our major
                                trading codebase.</li>
                            <li>Used React and Redux as the main framework, and as to asynchronous actions management, I
                                integrated Redux-observable into it.</li>
                            <li>Used modular CSS to prevent class name conflict and makes CSS easy to maintain.</li>

                            assets and using CDN to accelerate it, and using Node.js server to render SAP entry HTML
                            files just so we could rollback and grey publish them as needed.

                            <li>Used React and Redux to refactor all codebases. For preserving the ability for back-end
                                to change the page layout as needed, we designed a kind of JSON Schema for React to render it
                                dynamically.</li>
                            <li>In this project, we introduced webpack to our front-end team for the first time.</li>

                        <p>
                            Developed all pages in DXY mobile app's webview, and designed JS bridge for web

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            A Mac app to help you maintain your web browser habit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a front-end engineer, I am using Chrome as my dev tool on a daily basis, however, Safari
                            is my favorite browser in MacOS. I'm tired of copying and pasting links from browser to
                            browser while opening URL in IM messages or emails.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To solve this problem, I developed Browser Opener, which can be used as a browser dispatcher
                            to help you deciding which browser to open based on URL pattern.

                        <h4>Bangumi List</h4>
                        <p>
                            A website collecting all Japanese anime watch lists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There has been a lot of Japanese anime come to Chinese video websites, like Bilibili, Youku
                            or iQiyi, since 2013. But due to fragmentation of copyrights, it was hard to find them on
                            one single website. That's why I started this project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project is also my playground for chasing cutting edge of front-end technologies. It was first
                            written in plain HTML tables, and then be refactored to Angular, then jQuery, and finally
                            React. I'm considering making it to a Progress Web Application recently.
