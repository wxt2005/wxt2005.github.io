            <h3>Browser Opener</h3>
            <p>Browser Opener is a macOS application to help you open browsers based on URL.</p>
            <p>As a front-end engineer, I use Chrome for debugging applications but use Safari for other kinds of stuff. It's painful to switch between browsers when opening different URLs, for example, localhost or 127.0.0.1.</p> 
            <p>Browser Opener can help users decide which browser to open when clicking links. It now even supports browser profiles.</p>

            <h3>Reading List</h3>
            <p>Reading List is an application for collecting web pages for later reading, which supports iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.</p>
            <p>After trying several RIL services, I found they all contain features I don't need. Also, none of them supports iPad very well. So I created my own.</p>

            <h3>Bangumi List</h3>
            <p>Bangumi List is a Japanese anime information site.</p>
            <p>Back in China, due to the fragmentation of copyrights, it was hard to check which anime is on which video site. So I created this site to help Chinese anime fans to find out where to watch their favorite anime series.</p>
            <p>This site is also my playground of front-end technologies. It has gone through a long journey: plain HTML, jQuery, Angular, React. Recently it's refactored to TypeScript and added the login system.</p>
